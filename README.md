# YourAnimeList

this is my react.js app project for my laboratory assitant qualification in Binus University. In this project I created web app called YourAnimeList to provide information about latest anime and make user can add their favorite animes into favorite anime list. This app created using react.js and open source graphql [anilist](https://anilist.co/graphiql).\
this application then deployed using [vercel](vercel.com) with url https://qualification-react-js.vercel.app/
